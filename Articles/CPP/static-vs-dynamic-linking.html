	<p>
		There are two ways to include external libraries for use in programs; statically or dynamically. When statically linking, the code from the external libraries is included as part of the shipped executable. When dynamically linking, the external libraries are loaded and included at run-time. There are trade-offs in both cases. Statically linking libraries will increase the size of the executable. Dynamic linking reduces the size of the executable but requires that the libraries be located when the program is run. If the libraries are not available at runtime then the executable will report an error indicating that the libraries cannot be found.
