	<h2>Unstaging Files</h2>
	<p>
		If files are added (but not yet committed) that were not intended, such as those that should have been excluded via a .gitignore file, use the following command to unstage:<br/>
		<pre>git rm -r --cached &lt;name of file or directory&gt;</pre><br/>
		Note that the -r means to remove recursively in child directories.<br/>
